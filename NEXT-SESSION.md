# Next Session

## What Was Completed

Project bootstrapped with development conventions via Plan & Setup:
- Created CLAUDE.md with project conventions and commands
- Created TODO.md with prioritized task list
- Created ARCHITECTURE.md with system design
- Created .claude/commands/ with session workflow files
- Created .claude/rules/testing-rules.md
- Created docs/decisions/TEMPLATE.md for ADRs
- Initialized MEMORY.md

## What's Next

- Rename image files from WhatsApp names to clean names (see PLAN.md mapping)
- Build the `index.html` file with all 7 sections
- Start with HTML structure, then CSS styling, then JS interactivity

## Key Context

- Project bootstrapped with Plan & Setup agent
- All commands in .claude/commands/ reference CLAUDE.md for actual command strings
- This is a static site — no build tools, no package manager, no tests
- PLAN.md has the complete spec including text content, design guidelines, and image mappings
- Image files currently have long WhatsApp names that need renaming
