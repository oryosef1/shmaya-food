Start a new coding session by loading context and suggesting what to work on:

1. Read NEXT-SESSION.md for continuity — understand where we left off
2. Read TODO.md and identify unchecked items
3. Run `git log --oneline -10` for recent history (if git is initialized)
4. Run `git status` for uncommitted work (if git is initialized)
5. Open index.html in browser to verify current state: `open index.html`
6. Check if all images load correctly

Provide a session briefing with:
- Where we left off
- Current site state (does index.html exist? what sections are done?)
- Uncommitted changes
- Top 3-5 tasks from TODO.md
- Any blockers
