End-of-session wrap-up checklist:

1. **Verify the site** — Open index.html in browser, check for visual issues, broken images, broken links
2. **Update TODO.md** — Mark completed items as [x], add new items discovered during the session
3. **Update CLAUDE.md** — If architecture, commands, or conventions changed
4. **Update ARCHITECTURE.md** — If system design changed
5. **Write NEXT-SESSION.md** — Include:
   - What was completed this session
   - What's in progress
   - What's blocked
   - Key context for next session
6. **Update MEMORY.md** — Record gotchas, patterns, and lessons learned at `~/.claude/projects/-Users-orperelman-moms-website/memory/MEMORY.md`
7. **Git commit** — If git is initialized, stage and commit changes with a conventional commit message

Do NOT skip any step. Work is NOT complete until docs reflect reality.
